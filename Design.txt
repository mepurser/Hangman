#Full Stack Nanodegree Project 4 Refresh

##Hangman
The design I used was based on the original Guess-a-Number framework with
some additional modifications. In particular, the logic of the game was 
completely re-written for Hangman, but the logic is still contained within
the same 'make_move' method.

An additional 'prev_guesses' parameter had to be added to 'Game' class
in order to track previous guesses that had been made. An alternative to
this structure was to make an entirely separate class and ndb model to
track previous guesses, but it seemed much cleaner to simply track guesses
within the Game object itself using the ndb.JsonProperty type.

Rather than sending an email to every user every hour, I modified the cron
job to only send users with active games reminders.
